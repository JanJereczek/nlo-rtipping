- To get the similar oscillatory behaviour than Johannes when it comes to IC, we can simply set whatever damping is the one we want. Then create a circle with trigo function and add one or tweo more trigo to get the behaviour he gets! Then start from this IC.

- I observe NMRT even without initial perturbation on VPO. Could the power F dot v be a measure for this? (velocity defined with negatve sign to obtain unstable vdp). Seems to be roughly this. Put more effort into that explanation. Also something that can only happen in nl realm.

- Maybe a wavelet analysis would allow to understand the latter effect. Make product with linearised system spectrum (could give a good estimate?)
